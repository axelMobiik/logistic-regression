    "    We want to learn about Logistic Regression as a method fot <strong>Classification</strong>\n",
    "    <br>Some examples of classification problems:\n",
    "    <li>Spam versus \"Ham\" emails</li>\n",
    "    <li>Loan Default (yes/no)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Disease Diagnosis</li>\n",
    "    Above were all examples of Binary Classification\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    So far we've only seen regression problems where we try to predict a continuous value.\n",
    "    <br>Although the name may be confusing at first, logistic regressions allows us to solve classification problems, where we are trying to predict discrete categories.\n",
    "    <br>The convention for binary classification is to have two classes 0 and 1.\n",
    "    <br>We can't use a normal linear regression model on binary groups. It lead to a good fit.\n",
    "    <br>Instead we can transform our linear regression to a logistic regression curve.\n",
    "    <br>The Sigmoid (aka Logistic) Function takes in any value and outputs it to be between 0 and 1 (Tettha(z) = 1/(1 + e^(-z)))\n",
    "    <br>This means we can take our Linear Regression Solution and place it into the Sigmoid Function.\n",
    "    <br>This results in a probability from 0 to 1 of belonging in the 1 class.\n",
    "    <br>We use the logistic function to output a value ranging from 0 to 1. Based off of this probability we assign a class.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    After you train a logistic regression model on some training data, you will evaluate your model's performance on some test data.\n",
    "    <br>You can use a confusion matrix to evaluate classification models.\n",
    "    <br>We can use a confusion matrix to evaluate our model. For example, imagine testing for disease.\n",
